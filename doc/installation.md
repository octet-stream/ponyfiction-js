# Installation

<!-- will be added in future -->
<!-- **Important: Before you begin, please, read the [Introduction](./introduction.md) section of the docs.** -->

**Note: The project is still in early stage of development. You may have some issues with installation, but I'm working on project API stabilization. Stay in touch!**

1. Clone the repo:

  ```sh
  mkdir twi
  git clone git@github.com:octet-stream/twi.git twi
  ```

  ...or just download zip of lastest version: [https://github.com/octet-stream/twi/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/octet-stream/twi/archive/master.zip)
  
  ...or from releases, if you want to get a stable version: [https://github.com/octet-stream/twi/releases](https://github.com/octet-stream/twi/archive/master.zip)

2. Install dependencies from the console:

  ```
  yarn
  ```

  **Node: I recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for this operation.**

3. After that, you have to run installation script. Just run the following command:

  **Note: this command is not implemented for now, sorry for that**

  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```

5. That's it! Twi is ready for production! You can drink some coffee with a cupcake! ☕️
