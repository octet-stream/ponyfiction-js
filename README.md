# twi

Fanfiction library engine, mostly focused on **My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic** community.

The current project contains codebase related to Twilight's Library API getaway service needs.

ðŸš§ **IMPORTANT NOTE: Project is still in development
and isn't ready for production! Stay in touch.**

**I'm also do not accept pull requests (but feel free to ask me about this project),**
**because Twi have no stable API, docs and contributing policy.**
**All these things will be added soon.**
